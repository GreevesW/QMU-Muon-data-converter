# QMU-Muon-data-converter

This project was designed to be used as part of a competition at Queen Mary University.

Most results taken by the particle detector are unusable. This is because the muons entering the detector do not decay and therefore, no electrons are detected exiting the tube. Since the electrons are not detected,
the reading shows a very high decay time as the the timer is never told to stop. This code removes all of the unrealistic decay times, and creates a new txt file with relevant results within a reasonable range only.
